# `tabp` - A Lisp like language that operates on Table instead of list.

Tabp is a programming language inspired by Lisp and Lua. It borrows its syntax
from Lisp but uses table (similar to Lua tables) as it's only datastructure.
It is called Tabp because unlike Lisp (List Processor), it operates on tables.

Table is a datastructure that acts as a map and a vector/slice at the same time.
All entries are stored in map except those that are part of the **sequence**.
Table sequence define entries with an integer key `i` in range `0 to n` (exclusive)
where `Table.Get(i) != nil` and `Table.Get(n) == nil`.
